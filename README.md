# BIPV Facades Dataset

This repository contains a dataset of 400 architectural projects that feature Building-Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) Facades. An exploratory data analysis  of a curated dataset on BIPV facade projects is also available.  
The goal is to better understand the characteristics, geographical distribution, and temporal evolution of BIPV facades.
